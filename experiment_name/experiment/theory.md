Morse code is a method used in telecommunication with the use of dot(.) and dash(-) as signals to represent characters.Morse code is a binary system,where shorter signals like dots(.) represent individual characters and longer signals like dashes(-) represent words or special characters.

Special characters:  
                   Special characters are also known as special symbols or non-alphanumeric characters,they are symbols that are not letters,numerals or standard punctuation marks in a written language.Special characters are not limited to any specific alphabet or language and are often found in international character sets.
            Each special character in Morse code has a unique sequence of dots and dashes that represents it.These sequences are standardized to ensure consistent communication.  
Basic special characters morse code:  
| Character                | Code          | Character             | Code       |
|   :---:                  |     :---:     |     :---:             |   :---:    |
| Period[.]                |     .-.-.-    |   Colon[:]            |    ---...  |
| Comma[,]                 |    --..--     |   Semicolon[;]        |    -.-.-.  |
| Question mark [?]        |     ..--..    |     Double dash[=]    |    -...-   |
| Apostrophe[']            |     .----.    |    Plus[+]            |    .-.-.   |
| Exclamation mark[!]      |     -.-.--    |    Hyphen, Minus[-]   |    -....-  |
| Slash [/],Fraction bar   |     -..-.     |     Underscore[_]     |    ..--.-  |
| Parenthesis open[(]      |    -.--.      |    Quotation mark[“]  |    .-..-.  |
| Parenthesis close[)]     |    -.--.-     |    Dollar sign [$]    |    …-..-   |
| Ampersand [&],Wait       |     .-...     |    At sign[@]         |    .--.-.  |


These special characters are essential in Morse code communication, allowing for the transmission of a wide range of written language elements and additional notations. Morse code's efficiency and versatility make it a valuable tool in various communication contexts.
