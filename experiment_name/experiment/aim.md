<!-- Aim of the experiment and a paragraph describing the aim goes here -->

### Aim 
To acquire the ability to receive and understand Morse code transmissions of Syntax.


<!-- ### Objectives
1. **Alphabet Learning Through Sound:** Develop a feature that plays the corresponding sound for each Morse code alphabet when the user interacts with it. This audio feedback will help users associate Morse code sequences with the English alphabet.

2. **Alphabet Recognition:** Implement Morse code decoding algorithms that accurately convert Morse code signals into their corresponding alphabetical characters.

3. **Displaying Images for Morse Code Alphabets:** Implement an interactive component that displays images representing each Morse code alphabet. Visual cues can reinforce the user's understanding of Morse code and make the learning process more engaging.
